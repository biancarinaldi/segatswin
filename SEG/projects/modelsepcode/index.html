		<h2>Do Software Developers Make Use of Model Separated Code?</h2>

      		<p>
            	There are many guidelines and principles in software engineering about the way to structure and design a software system. Part of this includes the overall architecture design.
                A popular and widely recommended pattern is the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern.
            </p>
            <p>
            	However, there has been little empirical work and investigation into its use in real-world projects, that steam beyond the education in University, and such institutions, and
                textbooks. 
            </p>
            <p>
            	This study aims to investigate the use of MVC in open source Java projects, the implications of using (or not using) it, and whether, during the evolution of a software system,
                the components of the system that began as model separated code, start to blend the lines and lose the MVC structure that it started with.
            <p>
				Also of interest to this project is whether MVC's is resistant to evolution or software entropy and whether it supports the developer's task of structuring a software systems
                design to alleviate  the overall complexity and help with the overall understanding of system they are trying to build.
            </p>
            <p>
            	This is a quantitative exploratory and release based study focused on architectural inference of software systems.
