		<h2>Overview</h2>
		<div id="content">
		<h3>What is it?</h3>
		<p>Mutations is a tool used to examine the evolutionary aspects of a software system [Refer to Lehman's laws]</p>
		<h3>What does it do?</h3>
		<p>It extracts various metrics [link this to metric definitions] from a software system's source code and produces reports [link to report explanation pages] that help developers understand how their system is growing and changing [growing and changing needs further explanation].</p>
		<h3>How does it work?</h3>
		<p>It works by utilising the ASM [http://asm.ow2.org/] bytecode manipulation and analysis framework to extract metrics from Java bytecode [link to bytecode info page] belonging to a software system. This is performed upon the entire history [tooltip with explanation of 'history'] of the software system. Using these extracted metrics, Mutations forms an understanding of the software system and interprets how it is growing [define growth] and changing [define change] over its lifetime and what has brought has brought this about.</p>
		<h3>What is it good for?</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Helps 'read between the lines' in terms of how a software system is evolving [be more clear]</li>
		<li>Helps understand the tendencies of developers writing code</li>
		<li>Articulates how a software system has been built for different audiences</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What kind of reports does it generate?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Outlying versions report</li>
			<li>Focus class report</li>
			<li>Feature evolution report (coming soon)</li>
			<li>Refactoring report (coming soon)</li>
			<li>Architectural volatility report (coming soon)</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What kind of statistics does it use?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Gini Coefficient</li>
			<li>Theil Index</li>
			<li>Chi-square Distance</li>
			<li>Bhattacharyya Distance</li>
			<li>Regression Analysis</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>What are it's broad aims?</h3>
		<ul>
		<li>Identification of concepts within systems (domain-level language, features, etc.)</li>
		<li>Show how developers have built the system [be more clear]</li>
		<li>Identify trends of growth/change for the system
			</li>
		<li>
			Identify types of maintenance activities for the system
		</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Who is involved in it's development?</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="#rvasa">Rajesh Vasa</a></li>
			<li><a href="#ajones">Allan Jones</li>
			<li><a href="#brinaldi">Bianca Rinaldi</a></li>
			<li><a href="#lhoon">Leonard Hoon</a></li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Where did the name come from?</h3>
		<p>
		Taken from the mutation of DNA structures.
		<br />
		Well suited as a metaphor for software change.</p>
