			<h3>What is Helix?</h3>
			<p>Helix is a collection of open-source Java software systems that provides a means for analysis of software evolution. Each of the software systems that are apart of Helix are represented by their respective <a href="">release history</a> in the form of the compiled Java bytecode distributions which developers would normally acquire in order to use the systems.</p>
			<h3>What is the criteria for inclusion within Helix?</h3>
			<p>In order to be included within Helix, a software system must be:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Developed for the Java virtual machine and code and compiled binaries for each release must be available</li>
				<li>A single, coherent system, i.e. it is a distribution of a collection of related components packaged together</li>
				<li>Beyond 15 available stable releases that have a version identifier (can be major or minor releases)</li>
				<li>Actively developed and used for at least 36 months</li>
				<li>Composed of at least 100 types (class and interfaces) in all releases under study</li>
				<li>Accompanied with change logs that provide information regarding major architectural shifts</li>
